react-script help us to start the app

react always calls render() method,render() must return something(JSX)

Display Array

always use super() when ever we use constructor in JavaScript

Lifecycle Hook

Post API

npm i react-router@6.2.2

npm i react-router-dom@6.2.2




in redux task is called as action.
redux is basically a smart storage which notifies us  when someone make some changes in their code.


store-reducer-actions-components

npm i react-redux

npm i @reduxjs/toolkit

npm i redux-thunk

payload is the data

step-1
======
import necessary libraries

step-2
======
create store

step-3
======
create reducer



call the api save the data and dispatch to reducer

action->reducer->store->component(store will give the data to component)




if we want actions to return functions to reducer then we must use redux-thunk. we can directly return functions to reducer by usring objects but that is not recommended


[redux-thunk is a middlewire]


mapStateToProps() is used to connect a ract component to a redux store.


connect function is used to create a higher order component that connects component on which you are geting redux-store data.
